NAME
    Dancer::Template::TemplateFlute - Template::Flute wrapper for Dancer

VERSION
    Version 0.0061

DESCRIPTION
    This class is an interface between Dancer's template engine abstraction
    layer and the Template::Flute module.

    In order to use this engine, use the template setting:

        template: template_flute

    The default template extension is ".html".

  LAYOUT
    Each layout needs a specification file and a template file. To embed the
    content of your current view into the layout, put the following into
    your specification file, e.g. views/layouts/main.xml:

        <specification>
        <value name="content" id="content" op="hook"/>
        </specification>

    This replaces the contents of the following block in your HTML template,
    e.g. views/layouts/main.html:

        <div id="content">
        Your content
        </div>

  ITERATORS
    Iterators can be specified explicitly in the configuration file as
    below.

      engines:
        template_flute:
          iterators:
            fruits:
              class: JSON

            image:
              class: "Flowers::Filters::Image"
