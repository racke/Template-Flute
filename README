SYNOPSIS
        use Template::Flute;

        my ($cart, $flute, %values);

        $cart = [{...},{...}];
        $values{cost} = ...

        $flute = new Template::Flute(specification_file => 'cart.xml',
                               template_file => 'cart.html',
                               iterators => {cart => $cart},
                               values => \%values,
                               );

        print $flute->process();

DESCRIPTION
    Template::Flute enables you to completely separate web design and
    programming tasks for dynamic web applications.

    Templates are plain HTML files without inline code or mini language,
    thus making it easy to maintain them for web designers and to preview
    them with a browser.

    The CSS selectors in the template are tied to your data structures or
    objects by a specification, which relieves the programmer from changing
    his code for mere changes of class names.

  Workflow
    The easiest way to use Template::Flute is to pass all necessary
    parameters to the constructor and call the process method to generate
    the HTML.

    You can also break it down in separate steps:

    1. Parse specification
        Parse specification based on your specification format (e.g with
        Template::Flute::Specification::XML or
        Template::Flute::Specification::Scoped.).

            $xml_spec = new Template::Flute::Specification::XML;
            $spec = $xml_spec->parse(q{<specification name="cart" description="Cart">
                 <list name="cart" class="cartitem" iterator="cart">
                 <param name="name" field="title"/>
                 <param name="quantity"/>
                 <param name="price"/>
                 </list>
                 <value name="cost"/>
                 </specification>});

    2. Parse template
        Parse template with Template::Flute::HTML object.

            $template = new Template::Flute::HTML;
            $template->parse(q{<html>
                <head>
                <title>Cart Example</title>
                </head>
                <body>
                <table class="cart">
                <tr class="cartheader">
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>
                <th>Price</th>
                </tr>
                <tr class="cartitem">
                <td class="name">Sample Book</td>
                <td><input class="quantity" name="quantity" size="3" value="10"></td>
                <td class="price">$1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="cartheader"><th colspan="2"></th><th>Total</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                <td colspan="2"></td><td class="cost">$10</td>
                </tr>
                </table>
                </body></html>},
                $spec);

    3. Produce HTML output
            $flute = new Template::Flute(template => $template,
                                       iterators => {cart => $cart},
                                       values => {cost => '84.94'});
            $flute->process();

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
    Create a Template::Flute object with the following parameters:

    specification_file
        Specification file name.

    specification_parser
        Select specification parser. This can be either the full class name
        like MyApp::Specification::Parser or the last part for classes
        residing in the Template::Flute::Specification namespace.

    template_file
        HTML template file.

    database
        Template::Flute::Database::Rose object.

    filters
        Hash reference of filter functions.

    i18n
        Template::Flute::I18N object.

    values
        Hash reference of values to be used by the process method.

    auto_iterators
        Builds iterators automatically from values.

METHODS
  process [HASHREF]
    Processes HTML template, manipulates the HTML tree based on the
    specification, values and iterators.

    Returns HTML output.

  process_template
    Processes HTML template and returns Template::Flute::HTML object.

  filter FILTER VALUE
    Runs the filter named FILTER on VALUE and returns the result.

  value NAME
    Returns the value for NAME.

  set_values HASHREF
    Sets hash reference of values to be used by the process method. Same as
    passing the hash reference as values argument to the constructor.

  template
    Returns HTML template object.

  specification
    Returns specification object.

SPECIFICATION
    The specification ties the elements in the HTML template to the data
    (variables, lists, forms) which is added to the template.

    The default format for the specification is XML implemented by the
    Template::Flute::Specification::XML module. You can use the
    Config::Scoped format implemented by
    Template::Flute::Specification::Scoped module or write your own
    specification parser class.

    Possible elements in the specification are:

    container
        This container is only shown in the output if the value
        billing_address is set:

          <container name="billing" value="billing_address" class="billingWrapper">
          </container>

    list
    param
    value
        Value elements are replaced with a single value present in the
        values hash passed to the constructor of this class or later set
        with the set_values method.

        The following operations are supported for value elements:

        hook
            Insert HTML residing in value as subtree of the corresponding
            HTML element. HTML will be parsed with XML::Twig.

        toggle
            Only shows corresponding HTML element if value is set.

    input
    filter
    sort
    i18n

ITERATORS
    Template::Flute uses iterators to retrieve list elements and insert them
    into the document tree. This abstraction relieves us from worrying about
    where the data actually comes from. We basically just need an array of
    hash references and an iterator class with a next and a count method.
    For your convenience you can create an iterator from
    Template::Flute::Iterator class very easily.

LIST
    Template::Flute::List

FORMS
    Template::Flute::Form

    module.
